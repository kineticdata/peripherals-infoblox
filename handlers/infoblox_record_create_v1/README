    Create Associated PTR Record:           true

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the REST Infoblox API to create an A record (with the 
    possibility to also create a PTR record). After configuring the handler
    with the Url where the Infoblox server is hosted at along with the username
    and password of an account with the correct permissions, the handler will
    start to build the hash of information to send to Infoblox. The name and 
    zone will be appended with a period being added in between (so the zone
    should not have a leading period on it) to create the complete name to send
    in the REST call. Those parameters will then be sent to Infoblox to create
    the A record and if 'Create Associated PTR Record' is true a second call
    will be sent to create the PTR record.
